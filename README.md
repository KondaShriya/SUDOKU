# SUDOKU
Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as regions or blocks) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle starts with some cells already filled with numbers, and the objective is to fill in the remaining cells.

Here are the basic rules of Sudoku:

Grid: The standard Sudoku grid is a 9x9 square divided into nine 3x3 subgrids.

Digits: The digits 1 through 9 must appear exactly once in each row, each column, and each 3x3 subgrid.

Starting Numbers: Some cells in the grid are pre-filled with numbers, known as "givens" or "clues." These numbers provide a starting point for solving the puzzle.

Solving Process: Players use logical reasoning and deduction to determine the correct placement of numbers in the empty cells. They must adhere to the rules of the game while ensuring that each row, column, and subgrid contains the numbers 1 through 9 with no repetitions.

Difficulty Levels: Sudoku puzzles come in varying levels of difficulty, ranging from easy to expert. The difficulty is determined by the pattern and placement of the initial numbers and how challenging it is to solve the puzzle.

Solving Techniques: There are several solving techniques that players can employ, such as elimination, candidate lists, and crosshatching. More challenging puzzles may require advanced techniques like naked pairs, hidden singles, and X-wing strategies.

Sudoku has gained widespread popularity as a pencil-and-paper puzzle and is also available in various electronic formats, including online games and mobile apps. The game provides a good mental exercise, requiring concentration, pattern recognition, and logical thinking.

Sudoku tournaments, competitions, and championships are organized globally, and enthusiasts often compete to solve puzzles in the shortest time or with the highest accuracy. Additionally, Sudoku variants with different grid sizes, shapes, and rule modifications have been created to add diversity to the puzzle-solving experience.
